## Further Operation

Once set up, the AI/tool will operate until stopped. This can be done by either stopping the application with a keyboard command (Ctrl-C) or by exiting the application. (Command provides the safest shutdown)

The AI/tool can be run in multiple instances under the same executable, provided there is only one instance per exchange.

Should there be a need for multiple instances on the same exchange, there need to be unique installations of the tool.

## Build

To ensure that the most recent release is genuine check that the PGP-signature is that of Nescience Software & Capital.

Further, the best way to validate a new release is to build/compile the application yourself based on the Python scripts provided in the "Scripts" folder, while inspecting any new changes. This requires Python 3.5+ and a number of dependencies, and can be done following the steps below:

  1. If you do not already have Python 3.5+ as can be found here (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  
  2. Using this command, download pip (pythons package installation tool).
  
    ```
    
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    
    ```
    
  3. Ensure each dependency listed in "Dependencies.txt" are installed using pip.
  
    ```
    
    pip install 'package==version"
    
    ```
    
  4. For each exchange you would like to use, in your "Scripts" folder generate an additional folder with the name of the exchange.
     (Coinbase= "GDAX", Binance = "Binance", Kucoin= "Kucoin", Kraken= "Kraken", etc.)
     
  5. In each folder, create 2 JSON files with the following titles and the following content:
  
1. Title: "Config"

    Content:   
    ```
    {"configcheck": ""}
    ```
2. Title: "Initial:

    Content:
    ```
    {"initialcheck2": ""}
    ```

    
** At this point, the scripts will function if called using Python, run "Nescience_rebalance.py" and chose your exchange!    **
    
    
** If you would like a complete executable follow the steps below*
    
  6. Using the packaging tool of your choice (the most reccommended is Pyinstaller), compile/package the MAIN script, "Nescience_Rebalance". The steps to do so are different depending on system specifics and the packaging tool chosen. 
  
  NOTE:
  
  If the tool chosen does not recursively search for modules, ensure each script in the "Scripts" folder is included. 

  If the folders you created are not included, ensure that they are located in the same folder as your Nescience_Rebalance python script or executable. 
  
  If using Pyinstaller, we have found that strptime.py is commonly not imported, if you run into this issue simply add strptime.py to the data field of the spec file.
